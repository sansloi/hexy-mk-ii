# hexy-mk-ii

## Project Abstract
Hexy Mark II is the second iteration of Hexy Robotic Platform that was designed
by aspiring roboticist/song-writer `Julio B. Figueroa` in an attempt to "finally
get that project done".

## Getting Started

```bash
mkdir <folderName>
cd ~/<folderName>
git clone https://github.com/sansloi/hexy-mk-ii.git
```

### Software Requirements
